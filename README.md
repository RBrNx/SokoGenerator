## Future Ideas

* ** 'Open' dialog for users to load a .sok file, allowing Regeneration/Deletion of Levels in the Level Set**
* ** Separate Solver from Generator allowing users to load levels in and check for a solution**
* ** Drag & Drop Editor allowing users to create their own levels and save them to a level set**
* ** Sokoban Game instance created by the program, allowing users to play the Generated/Created Levels before saving**
* ** Decrease Solving time with improvements to the solver**

These are all ideas that I am working on or wanting to work on in the future. Any other suggestions please let me know.
